# Assignment 1 Task 1
### Manli Yang

### 1. Read the research article of the hands-on working group you are assigned to:
   * Spatial Transcriptional Mapping Reveals Site-Specific Pathways Underlying Human Atherosclerotic Plaque Rupture*
   https://www.jacc.org/doi/epdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.04.008

### 2. Answer the following questions
#####a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
*"plaque siteâ€“specific transcriptional signatures associated with proximal rupture-prone regions of carotid atherosclerotic plaques."*

##### b. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
*Histology, SEM, bulk and spatial RNA-seq, GWAS*

### 3. Further related research questions
##### a. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
- MMP9-Associated Pathway Analysis
- GWAS-Identified Variants Linked to MMP9
- Identification of Potential Therapeutic Targets Beyond MMP9 Based on Expression and Survival.
